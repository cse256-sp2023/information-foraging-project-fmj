            or

            Put no tag in the button tag if you do not want linked behavior, but just plain text

            Also remember that you can but more than just link tags in here. If you decide
            that you would actually like to have a button or an input of any kind of even just
            a <p>, <h1>, or <br> tag then go ahead and use on of those instead. They may require
            some extra css and js to get desired functionality but it can be done.
