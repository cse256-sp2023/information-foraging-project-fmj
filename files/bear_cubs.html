      <h1>Bear Cubs</h1>
      <h2>
        The Bear Cub class is the morning session for 3- and 4-year-old
        children. Their growing communication and motor skills allow these
        preschoolers to become more self-sufficient. Teacher guidance and
        routines in the classroom help build self-esteem and confidence in the
        children as they enjoy individual, small-group and large-group
        activities.

          </li>
          <li>
            Learn how to establish positive, constructive relationships with

                Marsha Graeber has taught at WUNS for 20 years. She currently works
                with the Bear Cubs in the morning and the Panda Bears in the
                afternoon. Marsha’s enthusiasm in the classroom is contagious. Her
                greatest joy in working with children is to provide a positive
                environment to support self-discovery, independence, resilience,
                confidence, curiosity, self-regulation and a strong self-esteem. She
                treasures all the relationships with children and their families
                cultivated over the years. Marsha believes that WUNS is a special
                place to teach because of the talented, respectful staff, the unique
                experiences of the children, and the open communication that the
                school community supports.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her Bachelor of Science degree in outdoor parks and recreation was
                attained at the University of Missouri in Columbia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Marsha is married to husband Ken; they have two daughters, Emily and
                Sarah. The whole family appreciates being active in the outdoors,
                enjoying running, golf, biking, hiking and working in the garden.
                The Graebers are also avid Cardinal baseball fans!

              <p>
                Katie is very excited to begin her fifth year at WUNS, in the 2019 –
                2020 school year teaching with Chona in the Teddy Bear classroom
                (mornings) and Colleen in the Sun Bear classroom (afternoons). She
                has taught kindergarten, first and second grades in the Ladue School
                District for many years.
              </p>
              <p>
                She attained her undergraduate degree in elementary education from
                Creighton University and her Master of Arts in teaching early
                education from Webster University. Katie is inspired by young
                children; she is constantly amazed by how they see the joy in simple
                things. One of her goals as a teacher is to provide an enriching
                environment that naturally fosters curiosity, engaging
                conversations, imaginative play, creative movement, and thoughtful
                expression. She believes WUNS is a special place because of its warm
                and welcoming energy and its unique location on a college campus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Katie and her husband Mike are St. Louis natives. They have four
                children, Alli (21), Jake (19), Elizabeth (17) and Will (14) and a
                dog Murphy, “the best West Highland White Terrier ever.” In her free
                time, Katie enjoys hiking, travel, swimming and being with her
                family.
