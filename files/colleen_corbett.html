          Colleen Corbett begins her seventh year as a teacher at WUNS,
          teaming for the sixth year with Katie in the Sun Bear classroom. She
          also is the Spanish specialist, teaching once weekly lessons to all
          the classrooms. In addition, Colleen coordinates the morning Bear
          Tracks program and maintains the WUNS website. She worked in the
          student technology and training department for five years at
          Washington University prior to transferring to the nursery school in
          2013.
        </p>

          Before coming to Washington University, she taught second grade for
          nine years at The College School. Her degrees include a Bachelor of
          Arts in English, with minors in Spanish, writing, and women’s
          studies, and a Master of Education, both attained from the
          University of Missouri. Additional graduate school hours in early
          childhood education and writing were attained at Webster University
          and Washington University in St. Louis. Her favorite activity with
          the children is sharing literature that connects to experiences in
          the classroom.

          Colleen loves to travel and play in the outdoors with her wonderful,
          over-functioning but humble husband. They live in Webster Groves
          with their fur-daughter, a mutt named Sadie who thinks she’s a
          princess. Their biological daughter is finally launched–she is a
          resident physician at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital.
