          Becky is thrilled to continue the Nature on the Move program that
          has been coming to WUNS for 19 years. Becky holds a Bachelor of
          Science in Early Childhood Education from the University of
          Missouri-Columbia. She has taught young children for a total of 18
          years, 6 in kindergarten and more recently 12 in Pre-K. Becky and
          her husband Randy have been married for 26 years and have four
          children, all currently in college. Becky and Randy love to spend
          time on their property in Northeastern Missouri near Mark Twain Lake
          where they enjoy watching and listening to all the wildlife,
          fishing, boating, and riding their horses. Becky believes that one
          way to preserve our natural resources is to teach the youngest
          members of our society to love and respect the natural world around
          them. Nature on the Move allows children to get up close to
          Missouriâ€™s wildlife and learn how each living thing affects the
          world in which they live.
