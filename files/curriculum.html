        <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
        <h2>
          Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to
          individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s interests
          and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe,
          nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
          developmental areas.
        </h2>

          The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most
          effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children
          act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process
          more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for
          children to interact with their environment in ways that are
          meaningful to them. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that
          reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom.
          In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in
          science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early
          education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if it would be
          enriching for our program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The staff at the nursery school respects and appreciates the talents
          and personalities of each child and his or her family. A teacher’s
          individual talents are also encouraged as she or he develops his or
          her own personal approach in the classroom. This makes for a vibrant,
          growing community of children, families and teachers.

        <p>
          At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are
          unique individuals with their own patterns and timetables for social,
          emotional, intellectual, and physical development. We support and
          encourage their development through our child-centered,
          process-oriented, playbased curriculum built on Constructivist
          theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of educational
          theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we
          create a learning environment that addresses the developmental needs
          of the whole child.
