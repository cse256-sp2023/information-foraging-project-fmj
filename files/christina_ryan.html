          I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
          year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
          taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
          teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed
          a variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but
          I have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
          music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
          make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to
          share that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little
          boy who is a Big Bear and Sunbear.
        </p>

          I have been married to my high school sweetheart, Stephen, for 18
          years. In addition to our son, Brendon, we have our little ladybug,
          Isabelle. When I’m not trying to keep up with my littles, I enjoy
          volunteering with our church, neighborhood groups, and—of course!—at
          WUNS. I also love to read, play flute and piano, do anything artsy
          and crafty, and go out to eat at restaurants.
