        <p>
          Marsha Graeber has taught at WUNS for 20 years. She currently works
          with the Bear Cubs in the morning and the Panda Bears in the
          afternoon. Marshaâ€™s enthusiasm in the classroom is contagious. Her
          greatest joy in working with children is to provide a positive
          environment to support self-discovery, independence, resilience,
          confidence, curiosity, self-regulation and a strong self-esteem. She
          treasures all the relationships with children and their families
          cultivated over the years. Marsha believes that WUNS is a special
          place to teach because of the talented, respectful staff, the unique
          experiences of the children, and the open communication that the
          school community supports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her Bachelor of Science degree in outdoor parks and recreation was
          attained at the University of Missouri in Columbia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marsha is married to husband Ken; they have two daughters, Emily and
          Sarah. The whole family appreciates being active in the outdoors,
          enjoying running, golf, biking, hiking and working in the garden.
          The Graebers are also avid Cardinal baseball fans!
