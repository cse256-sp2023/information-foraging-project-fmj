          width="299" height="199">

        <p>
          Open House is a time for our students to show family their indoor
          and outdoor learning spaces: the classrooms and playground. Open
          House is held for a few hours on a Saturday or Sunday in October.
          Families are encouraged to stop by at some point during the Open
          House event. This is also a great opportunity for families to meet
          other families within the school.

          alt="A girl holds seeds in her hand" width="299" height="199">

        <p>
          Family Play Dates are held two or three times each semester on the
          playground from 3:15 p.m. – 5 p.m. Siblings and snacks are welcome.
          Play dates provide another opportunity to meet other families from
          the nursery school while your children play with their classmates.

      <h3>Family Night at the Magic House</h3>
      <div class="inner-item">
        <p>
          Each year the nursery school rents out the Magic House for a winter
          night of fun from 6-8 p.m. WUNS families and friends have the Magic
          House all to themselves. Children often remark that it is their
          favorite event of the year!

          alt="A girl holds seeds in her hand" width="299" height="199">

        <p>
          Once each semester, the classrooms have a special celebration for
          families and friends. We invite dads and granddads in the fall and
          moms and grandmoms in the spring. Of course, any special friend is
          invited, and we are very flexible about who attends each semester.
          The children may prepare a special snack, perform a song or dance or
          simply enjoy time in their classroom with their special visitor.
          These events take place during the school day and last approximately
          one hour.

          alt="A girl holds seeds in her hand" width="299" height="199">

        <p>
          Children celebrate Halloween with a short parade, special snack and
          a few holiday-themed activities. Children are encouraged to wear
          costumes if they feel comfortable. Family and friends are welcome to
          attend. The event lasts about an hour during both the morning and
          afternoon classes. See the
          calendar for
          the exact date of the Halloween celebration each year.

      <h3>Fall Parent Social</h3>
      <div class="inner-item">
        <p>
          Room parents are encouraged to organize a parent-only or
          child-parent event for their particular classroom. In the past, room
          parents have planned gatherings, such as a cocktail happy hour or a
          potluck play date at a park.

      <h3>Spring Fundraiser</h3>
      <div class="inner-item">
        <p>
          Every spring, the room parents organize a fundraiser and social
          gathering for adults. Trivia night, gallery night and progressive
          dinners are just a few things that have been fun successes in the
          past.

      <h3>Picnic</h3>
      <div class="inner-item">
        <p>
          Each year, we open and close our school year with picnics at Shaw
          Park. Under one of the pavilions, families and staff enjoy a
          barbeque potluck. The spacious and well-built play space next to the
          pavilion keeps the children entertained. Teachers and staff
          especially love seeing our school’s alumni join their siblings at
          the picnics.

      <h3>Teacher Appreciation Lunch</h3>
      <div class="inner-item">
        <p>
          Each classroom picks one day to provide a lunch for our classroom
          teachers and Washington University student assistants. Families
          volunteer at the beginning of the year, and each room parent helps
          organize the lunch. Our teachers greatly enjoy this gesture of
          appreciation.
