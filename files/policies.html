        <h3>Discipline</h3>
        <p>
          The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and
          nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary
          to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time
          as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our
          rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends
          safe, and the toys at school safe. The staff is trained to anticipate
          potentially problematic situations; they remind children of
          appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most
          cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something
          negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party
          to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will
          turn their attention to the child who might need more support in
          “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies
          safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to
          discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.

        <p>
          When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will
          work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate
          recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding
          and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we
          cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined
          that a child is not growing from his/her preschool experience at the
          Nursery School, a discussion will be held with parents at which it may
          be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child. The
          director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool
          programs and relevant community services if parents so desire.
        </p>
        <h3>Parking</h3>
        <p>Free	parking	is	available	adjacent	to	the	Nursery	School.		These	three, 30-minute	spots	are	
          typically	available	during	the	school	day.		Parking	in	Zone	3	is	only	permitted	with	a	Yellow	
          Zone	3	parking	pass.		Parents	and	visitors	wishing	to	have a longer	visit	should	park	in	the	
          Millbrook	or	Snow	Way	parking	garages,	located	off	Throop	Drive	and	Snow	Way.		Visitor	
          parking	in	these	lots	is	$2.00	for	the	first	two hours.		The	Nursery	School	will	provide	
          validation	tickets	to	parents	that	park	in	the	garage	for	special	school	events.</p>
        <h3>Clothing</h3>
        <p>It	is	recommended	that	children	be	dressed	in	play	clothes	that	are	comfortable,	washable,	
          and	suitable	for	activities	both	indoors	and	outdoors.		Children	need	to	have	at	least	one	
          extra	set	of	clothing	appropriate	to	the	season	that	can	be	kept	at	school.	Parents	should	be	
          aware	of	weather conditions	and	dress	children	accordingly,	as	outdoor	play	is	an	integral	
          part	of	the	daily	schedule.		During	the	winter	months	our	general	guideline	for	outdoor	play	
          is	that	we	will	usually	go	outside	when	it	is	above	20	degrees,	with	wind	chill	taken	into	
          account.		Please	mark	your	child’s	name	in	permanent	marker	on	all	clothing	so	that	it	can	be	
          easily	identified.</p>
        <h3>Snacks</h3>
        <p>The	nursery	school	provides	a	healthy	snack	each	day	for	the	children.	Fresh	fruit	(apples,	
          oranges,	pears,	bananas,	melons,	etc.)	are	purchased	each	week	and	kept	in	the	“children’s	
          refrigerator.”	There	are	a	wide	variety	of	crackers	(soda,	graham,	Ritz,	Goldfish,	etc.)	
          available.	Snack	time	consists	of	a	fruit,	crackers	and	water.	The	older	children	learn	to	pour	
          their	own	water.</p>
        <h3>Birthday Celebrations</h3>
        <p>We	celebrate	each	child’s	birthday	(or	half-birthday	for	children	with	summer	dates).		If	
          desired,	talk	with	your	child’s	teacher	about	bringing	a	special	snack	to	share	with	the	class.</p>
        <h3>Holidays</h3>
        <p>We	are	fortunate	to	have	diverse	cultures	and	religious	beliefs	in	our	nursery	school	
          community.		Our	policy	is	to	celebrate	family	traditions,	not	the	religious	aspects,	of	holidays.</p>
        <h3>Field Trips</h3>
        <p>Teachers	frequently	plan	short	walking	trips	on	campus.		Occasionally,	trips	are	planned	offcampus	to	further	enhance	the	children’s	experiences.		Each	time	an	off-campus	trip	is	planned,	parents	will	be	notified	in	advance	and	required	to	sign	a	form	granting	permission	
          for	the	child’s	participation.</p>
        <h3>Medication</h3>
        <p>The	nursery	school	encourages	parents	to administer	medications	at	home	and	not at	school.		
          The	nursery	school	staff	does	not	routinely	administer	medications	to	the	children.		Also,	we	
          do	not	apply sunscreen	or	insect	repellent.		Medication	that	absolutely	needs	to	be	
          administered	during	school	hours	must	be	cleared	with	the	director.</p>
        <h3>Allergies</h3>
        <p>If	your	child	has	a	known	allergic	reaction,	this	must	be	documented	on	the	child’s	History	
          and	Health	Record	kept	in	his/	her	file	in	the	office.		Also,	please	report	these	allergies	to	the
          classroom	teachers.		For	your	child’s	safety,	these	allergies	will be	posted	in	your	child’s	
          classroom.		If	you	object	to	this	information	being	posted,	please	contact	the	director.		In	case	
          of	severe	allergies	such	as	to	bee	stings or	nuts,	an	EpiPen	Injector	Kit	may	be	kept	at	the	
          nursery	school	and	used	by	the	director	and/or	teachers	who	are	trained	in	its	
          administration.		This	is	stored	in	the	emergency	backpack in	the	child’s	classroom.		Each	
          classroom	has	a	First	Aid	Kit	that	includes	the	EpiPen	(if	required).		This,	along	with	
          emergency	medical	forms	for	every	child,	accompanies	the	classes	on	all	walking	or	driving	
          field	trips.</p>
        <h3>Peanut and Tree Nut Policy</h3>
        <p>A	growing	number	of	children	deal	with	food	allergies	and,	specifically, potentially	lifethreatening	peanut	and	tree	nut	allergies.	 Washington	University	Nursery	School	will	be	a	
          peanut- and	tree	nut-free (Brazil	nuts,	almonds,	cashews,	pistachios,	walnuts,	pecans,	and	
          hazelnuts) preschool	beginning	with	the	2017-2018	school	year.	 The	full	explanation	of	
          the Peanut	and	Tree	Nut	Policy describes	how	teachers	and	families	will	support	the	efforts	
          of	safeguarding	the	health	and	safety	of	the	children.</p>
        <h3>Accidents</h3>
        <p>The	nursery	school	makes	every	effort	to	ensure	the	safety	of	all	children.		However,	should	a	
          serious	accident	occur,	a	parent	is	immediately	contacted.		If	parents	and	emergency	contacts	
          cannot	be	reached,	we	will	take	your	child	to	the	hospital	designated	on	your	enrollment	
          form.		Minor	injuries	will	be	reported	to	you	by	your	child’s	teacher	at	pick-up.	All	injuries	
          will	also	be	reported	in	written	form	and	given	to	you	at	pickup	time.	We	will	ask	you	to	sign	
          an	identical	form	to	be	placed in	your	child’s	file	at	school.</p>
        <h3>Health policy</h3>
        <p>The	nursery	school	makes	a	great	effort	to	provide	a	healthy	environment	for	your	children.		
          We	work	diligently	on	forming	healthy	habits	such	as	washing	hands	before	eating	or	
          handling	food,	and	after	toileting.		Our	dishes	and	cups	are	put	through	a	dishwasher/	
          sanitizer	to	sterilize	them	and	to	prevent	the	spread	of	germs.		The	rooms	are	thoroughly	cleaned	daily	and	checked	for	safety.		However,	despite	everyone’s	best	efforts,	children	and	
          adults	will	get	sick.		It	is	an	expected	part	of	life.		If	children	become	ill	at	school,	they	will	be	
          cared	for	in	the	office	until	a	parent	can	pick	them	up.	</p>
          <p>Parents	are	requested	to	keep	their	child	home	in	the	event	of	the	diseases	or	symptoms	
            noted	below.		The	child	will	be	allowed	to	return	to	school	when	he	or	she	has	been	free	of	
            these	symptoms	and	has	not	required	medication	for	a	minimum	of	24	hours.		If	a	symptom	
            persists	(such	as	rash	or	cough),	or	if	a	communicable	disease	is	confirmed	(measles,	chicken	
            pox,	etc.),	returning	to	school	may	require	a	statement	from	the	child’s	physician	declaring	
            that	the	condition	is	no	longer	contagious.</p>
            <p>PLEASE	CALL	the	nursery	school	to	inform	us	that	your	child	is	sick,	especially	if	he/	she	has	
              a	communicable	disease.		Communicable diseases	or	conditions	include:
            <li>strep	throat </li>
            <li>mumps</li>
            <li>hepatitis A</li>
            <li>scabies</li>
            <li>certain other bacterial infections</li>
            <li>chicken pox</li>
            <li>impetigo</li>
            <li>diarrheal diseases</li>
            <li>pinworm</li>
            <li>measles</li>
            <li>conjunctivitis</li>
            <li>lice</li>
            <li>ringworm</li>
          </p>
          <p>Also,	the	following	symptoms	could	indicate a	contagious	disease:
            <li>fever</li>
            <li>diarrhea</li>
            <li>vomiting</li>
            <li>skin eruptions/ rashconstant sneezing/ productive cough</li>
            <li>runny nose</li>
            <li>lethargy</li>
            <li>sore throat</li>
            <li>reddened, weeping eyes</li>
          </p>
          <p>If	your	child	is	exposed	to	or	contracts	a	communicable	disease,	it	is	essential	that	you call	
            the	nursery	school	to	tell	us.		In	turn,	we	will	send	a	letter	home	to	inform	parents	that	your	
            child	has	been	exposed	to	a	communicable	disease.	</p>
            <h3>Drop-Off	and	Pick-Up</h3>
            <p>All	traffic	for	arrival	and	dismissal	must	proceed	from	the	parking	lot	entrance	west	of	the	
              school,	driving	east	and	stopping	at	the	school	entrance.	Drivers	stay	in	their	cars	and	
              13 teachers	help	the	children	enter	and	exit.	Teachers	are	outside	for	arrival	of	children	at	8:50	
              a.m.	for	the	morning	session	and	12:30 p.m.	for	the	afternoon	session.		At	no	time	should	
              your	child	be	allowed	to	exit	your	car	without	a	teacher	present.		If	you	arrive	late,	you	must	
              escort	your	child	to	the	classroom.		At	dismissal	(11:45	a.m.	and	3:15	p.m.)	children	assemble	
              outside	the	front	door	on	benches	or,	in	inclement	weather,	inside	the	front	door.		The	
              teachers	bring	children	to	their	cars.		No	child	can	be	dismissed	to	anyone	other	than	persons	
              designated	(in	writing)	by the	parents.	Your	child	must	hold	hands	with	a	teacher	or	parent	
              when	in	front	of	the	school	in	the	drop-off/pick-up	area.</p>
