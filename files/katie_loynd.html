        <p>
          Katie is very excited to begin her fifth year at WUNS, in the 2019 –
          2020 school year teaching with Chona in the Teddy Bear classroom
          (mornings) and Colleen in the Sun Bear classroom (afternoons). She
          has taught kindergarten, first and second grades in the Ladue School
          District for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
          She attained her undergraduate degree in elementary education from
          Creighton University and her Master of Arts in teaching early
          education from Webster University. Katie is inspired by young
          children; she is constantly amazed by how they see the joy in simple
          things. One of her goals as a teacher is to provide an enriching
          environment that naturally fosters curiosity, engaging
          conversations, imaginative play, creative movement, and thoughtful
          expression. She believes WUNS is a special place because of its warm
          and welcoming energy and its unique location on a college campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Katie and her husband Mike are St. Louis natives. They have four
          children, Alli (21), Jake (19), Elizabeth (17) and Will (14) and a
          dog Murphy, “the best West Highland White Terrier ever.” In her free
          time, Katie enjoys hiking, travel, swimming and being with her
          family.
