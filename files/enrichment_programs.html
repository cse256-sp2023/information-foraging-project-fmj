      <h1>Enrichment Programs</h1>
      <h2>
        In addition to their classroom teachers, all children enrolled in the
        Washington University Nursery School interact regularly with
        specialists in art, music, Spanish and science.

      <h3>Art with Miss Suzy</h3>
      <p>
        <a class="download" href="downloads/WUNS-announcement-ART.pdf" target="_blank">Letter from Ms. Suzy about WUNS
          Art Enrichment for School Year
          2019-2020</a><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
        Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
        each month and build understanding through conversations and
        experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
        home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
        of Art.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
        since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
        the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
        and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
        each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
        personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!
      </p>
      <h3>Music with Ms. Christina</h3>
      <p>
        I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
        year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
        taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
        teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
        variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
        have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
        music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
        make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
        that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
        a Big Bear and Sun Bear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
        songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
        children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
        classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
        voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
        instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
        create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
        tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
        fun!

      <h3>Spanish with Miss Colleen</h3>
      <p>¡Hola! (Hello!) de Señora Colleen (from Miss Colleen)</p>
      <p>
        I am excited to begin my seventh year teaching the Spanish enrichment
        program at WUNS. My philosophy in teaching Spanish is to keep it fun,
        simple and multi-sensory. Whether through song, props, games or
        movement, I like to introduce vocabulary and simple phrases in
        memorable ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes for
        songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will list the
        vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or an overview
        of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will circle back to
        certain lessons throughout the year for review and recall.

      <h3>Nature on the Move with Miss Becky</h3>
      <p>
        I am thrilled to be continuing the Nature on the Move program that has
        been coming to WUNS for 18 years. I believe that one way to preserve
        our natural resources is to teach the youngest members of our society
        to love and respect the natural world around them. Nature on the Move
        allows children to get up close to Missouri’s wildlife and learn how
        each living thing affects the world in which they live. I will visit
        WUNS once per month with a lively presentation on a variety of topics.
