        <p>
          Suzy Frillman has taught in the early education field since 1996.
          She joined the WUNS staff in 2001. Her undergraduate degree is in
          art education (K – 12) from Missouri State University. She also
          attained a Master of Arts in early childhood education from Webster
          University.
        </p>

          Suzy teaches in the Big Bear classroom and is the art specialist at
          WUNS, bringing her passion for teaching art through literature and
          hands-on experiences to the children. She also coordinates the
          afternoon Bear Tracks program. Suzy believes that WUNS is a special
          place to teach because of the diversity of the families and the
          school’s commitment to the developmental needs of the students.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is married to her terrific husband Adam and her lovely daughter
          Sydney (a nursery school alum). Outside of school, Suzy enjoys time
          with her family, taking walks, enjoying nature, making art,
          practicing yoga, and watching Sydney play soccer.
