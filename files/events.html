              Open House is a time for our students to show family their indoor
              and outdoor learning spaces: the classrooms and playground. Open
              House is held for a few hours on a Saturday or Sunday in October.
              Families are encouraged to stop by at some point during the Open
              House event. This is also a great opportunity for families to meet
              other families within the school.

              Family Play Dates are held two or three times each semester on the
              playground from 3:15 p.m. – 5 p.m. Siblings and snacks are welcome.
              Play dates provide another opportunity to meet other families from
              the nursery school while your children play with their classmates.

          <h3>Family Night at the Magic House</h3>
          <div class="inner-item">
            <p>
              Each year the nursery school rents out the Magic House for a winter
              night of fun from 6-8 p.m. WUNS families and friends have the Magic
              House all to themselves. Children often remark that it is their
              favorite event of the year!

          <h3>Relative’s & Special Friend’s Days</h3>
          <div class="inner-item">
            <p>
              Once each semester, the classrooms have a special celebration for
              families and friends. We invite dads and granddads in the fall and
              moms and grandmoms in the spring. Of course, any special friend is
              invited, and we are very flexible about who attends each semester.
              The children may prepare a special snack, perform a song or dance or
              simply enjoy time in their classroom with their special visitor.
              These events take place during the school day and last approximately
              one hour.

          <h3>Halloween</h3>
          <div class="inner-item">
            <p>
              Children celebrate Halloween with a short parade, special snack and
              a few holiday-themed activities. Children are encouraged to wear
              costumes if they feel comfortable. Family and friends are welcome to
              attend. The event lasts about an hour during both the morning and
              afternoon classes. See the
              calendar for
              the exact date of the Halloween celebration each year.

          <h3>Fall Parent Social</h3>
          <div class="inner-item">
            <p>
              Room parents are encouraged to organize a parent-only or
              child-parent event for their particular classroom. In the past, room
              parents have planned gatherings, such as a cocktail happy hour or a
              potluck play date at a park.

          <div class="inner-item">
            <p>
              Every spring, the room parents organize a fundraiser and social
              gathering for adults. Trivia night, gallery night and progressive
              dinners are just a few things that have been fun successes in the
              past.

          <h3>Picnic</h3>
          <div class="inner-item">
            <p>
              Each year, we open and close our school year with picnics at Shaw
              Park. Under one of the pavilions, families and staff enjoy a
              barbeque potluck. The spacious and well-built play space next to the
              pavilion keeps the children entertained. Teachers and staff
              especially love seeing our school’s alumni join their siblings at
              the picnics.

          <h3>Teacher Appreciation Lunch</h3>
          <div class="inner-item">
            <p>
              Each classroom picks one day to provide a lunch for our classroom
              teachers and Washington University student assistants. Families
              volunteer at the beginning of the year, and each room parent helps
              organize the lunch. Our teachers greatly enjoy this gesture of
              appreciation.
