                        The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a
                        cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St.
                        Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the
                        highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7
                        months to 5 years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children
                        are from families of Washington University in St. Louis faculty,
                        staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the
                        community.

                        National Association for the Education of Young Children, by
                        which&nbsp;it&nbsp;is accredited. It is licensed by the State of

                        The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child
                        development and early childhood teacher training. Washington
                        University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to
                        assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the
                        nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student workers’
                        presence enables children to receive additional individual
                        attention.

                        The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus.
                        It is composed of three classrooms which are designed to offer
                        children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional
                        all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of
                        indoor gross motor play materials.&nbsp;A large outdoor play area
                        gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide
                        and play in the sand.
