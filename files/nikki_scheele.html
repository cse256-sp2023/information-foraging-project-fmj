          Nikki’s early education experience spans 15 years. She began
          teaching at WUNS in 2009. Prior to that, she worked as a service
          coordinator for Special School District for six years, providing
          education and support for parents of children with special needs.
          She also served as a social worker in Collinsville, Illinois, for
          three years.

          Nikki earned her Bachelor of Science degree in kinesiology from the
          University of Michigan and her Master of Social Work from Washington
          University in St. Louis. Inspired by her first science teacher, she
          loves to teach children about science and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          She enjoys seeing preschoolers explore and discover the wonders in
          their world. WUNS is a special place to work and teach, Nikki
          believes, because the dedicated staff understands the unique needs
          of children. In addition, the campus location makes for special
          opportunities for children to engage with a higher education
          environment.

          Nikki, originally from Michigan, has been married to her best
          friend, Chris Scheele, for 21 years, and they call University City
          home. They have two children—son Nick and daughter Parker, both WUNS
          alums. In her free time, Nikki loves to spend time with family and
          neighbors. Her home is known for its get-togethers, particularly
          postseason Cardinal games. Travel is also a favorite hobby; her
          family has visited the Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil and Europe and
          looks forward to new travel adventures every summer.
