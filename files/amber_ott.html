        <p>
          Amber has worked at the Nursery School since 2002. She attained her
          Bachelor of Science in education at the University of Kansas (Go
          Jawhawks!) and her Master of Arts in education from the University
          of South Florida.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has taught middle school children in Iceland, Florida,
          California and St. Louis. Amber and her husband have three
          children—daughter Taylor, and sons Max and Cade. All three children
          attended preschool at WUNS.

          She believes that the amazing teachers and families make WUNS a
          special place to work. Amber’s administrative skills help keep all
          the day-to-day operations of the school running smoothly. She also
          coordinates the student workers’ schedules and the parent
          association activities. In her spare time, Amber enjoys tennis and
          reading.
