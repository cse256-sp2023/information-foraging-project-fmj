        <p>
          Chona is beginning her 13th year as a teacher in the Nursery School.
          She teams with Marbie in the Teddy Bear classroom and Marsha in the
          Panda Bear classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chona has over 20 years of experience in the early childhood
          education field. Her degrees include a Bachelor of Arts in
          psychology from the University of Kansas and a Master of Arts in
          teaching from Webster University. Chona’s favorite times with the
          WUNS children include art activities—she enjoys watching them create
          using different media. Circle time is another favorite of hers, when
          children enjoy listening to stories and predicting what happens
          next, as well as singing and counting to teacher-led prompts. For
          Chona, WUNS is a very special place to teach because of the diverse
          families that enroll. She also appreciates working with her
          teammates and collaborating with the other teachers on staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chona is married with two children in college. During her free time,
          she loves to spend time with her family, read, garden and walk her
          dogs.
