          Heather Huewe is thrilled to begin her third year teaching at WUNS.
          After staying home for several years to raise four daughters,
          Heather eagerly returned to the classroom and found WUNS to be a
          wonderful fit. Heather was drawn to WUNS for its warm, family
          environment, its collegiality, its professionalism, and the
          opportunity to work not only with young children but also with young
          adults from Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to having her
          daughters, Heather taught first, sixth, and eighth grade over the
          course of twelve years at MICDS, and developed a love for each age
          group. She teams with Suzy in the morning Big Bears.
        </p>

          Heather earned her BA in Speech and Communications from the
          University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Tarheels!) and an
          MAT in Early Childhood Education from Emory University.

          A devoted runner for her entire adult life, she will begin coaching
          her tenth season of Girls on the Run this fall, and has completed
          several marathons for charity. Heather is most proud of coordinating
          the annual Race for Refugees, which benefits the International
          Institute of St. Louis. This venture combines her love of running
          with her belief in giving back to our shared community. In her free
          time Heather loves to stay active and get outside with her kind
          husband – and fellow educator – Patrick, their four unique daughters
          Rosie, Grace, Anna, and Mary Catherine, and crazy pup Charlie.
          Together they like to walk to their friendly Olivette neighborhood
          Starbucks, ride bikes to the bookstore (more coffee!), go to the
          zoo, play tennis and soccer, and of course run. Heather also loves
          to read, bake, keep up with current events, and stay connected with
          friends, family, and neighbors (a.k.a. talk…just ask her family!).
